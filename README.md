# CODSOFT 🚀

This repository contains a collection of coding tasks and mini-projects completed by **Kanishka Dinesh Wani**.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and problem-solving using **Python** (and C for some tasks).  

Each folder represents an independent project with its own functionality and codebase.
